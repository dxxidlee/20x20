                <p>20X20 is a collection of conversations with tobacco users, exploring why people smoke despite its well-documented health risks. The name derives from two key references: the average life lost per cigarette—approximately 20 minutes (17 minutes for men, 22 for women) and the 20 cigarettes in a standard pack. Together, they form a stark equation—400 minutes lost per pack.</p>
                <p>Inspired by cigarette warning labels outside the U.S., 20X20 presents a custom-designed pack with six cigarettes extending from it. Users can hover, click, or tap on a cigarette to access a conversation, accompanied by the interviewee's favorite smoking song. This immersive experience invites users to engage at their own pace—perhaps even with a cigarette in hand, though that's certainly not encouraged.</p>
                <p>Rather than romanticizing or justifying smoking, 20X20 offers an unfiltered look at personal motivations and attitudes toward tobacco use. Whether you're a smoker or non-smoker, the project invites introspection, understanding, and perspective.</p>

                <span class="answer">You want my legal name? (laughs) Abigail Song Kim. I normally smoke around three to four times a day. Depends.</span>

                <span class="answer">On a day I don't have as many classes, probably a little bit less. Just because I feel like the act of going outside… I'm just kind of lazy.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So the more classes you have, the more you smoke?</span>

                <span class="answer">Yes.</span>

            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Logical… and did you know smoking one cigarette deducts 20 minutes of your lifespan?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I didn't before you told me a few weeks ago… Well, I obviously knew it did shorten it to some extent, but I didn't know it was 20 minutes.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So why do you smoke? Kind of sounds like a weird question, but that's the whole point of the interview, you know?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah, I got you. Um, I would say mostly that… it's kind of ingrained in my routine, a decent amount. I've been kind of addicted to nicotine since sophomore year of high school.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Did you start with vaping or cigarettes?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I started with vaping, and that kind of started as like, "Oh, my friends are doing it." I tried it, not thinking that it would lead to six years of this, but…</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Do you feel like being at our school, where a lot of students smoke, and it also being in the city makes you smoke more?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">The chances of smoking definitely increase. I mean… I think I'm at a point now where it's been better than a couple of years ago, where I can just, like, stop if I really wanted to. I know that a lot of people say, "Oh, I can stop whenever I want," but I have done it before in the past, which kind of gives me some insurance about it. But being around friends who smoke does make it more convenient and more of like a, "Yeah, I'll do that."</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Do you think you smoke because of your friends and the people you're around, or is it past that point where you just do it to take a break or whatever?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I think the accessibility has to do with my friends smoking, like, a decent amount. Like, when we're on a break, you and I will go outside, and we both have several friends who do, too. So that's definitely part of it. But also, it's a huge stress reliever and almost a crutch.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah. Do you like listening to music when you smoke?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Oh, yeah, always. It's like part of the experience for me.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">What song do you think you listen to the most when you smoke?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Probably "Lavender Buds" by MF DOOM. It just puts me in this really chill, hazy vibe that makes smoking feel even better. The beat is so mellow, it kind of slows everything down for me.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">That makes sense. So even if you were smoking alone, it wouldn't feel as empty?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah, exactly. I think it fills the space in a way. Like, even when I smoke with people, we're usually listening to something anyway.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah, I get that. Do you think you'll keep smoking even after you graduate? Like, if you end up in a corporate job where people also take smoke breaks? Or do you have a goal for quitting?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I don't know if I have a specific goal. It's definitely something I don't wanna do for the rest of my life. I think all the time, if I had never started, would I be doing it now? So there is a definite kind of future goal to quit. I'm conscious of it, but also, like… I don't know exactly. We'll see.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah. I hope we can all quit by the time we're looking at this website or something, like, 10 years later. Saying, "Oh, yeah, I fucking quit."</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">(laughs) I thought you were talking about the final critique.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">No, no, no—(loud car honk) Damn, they really had to ruin it like that.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Can you include that in the interview? (laughing) That's gonna be so funny.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">(coughs)</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">But yeah, besides it being a stress reliever, it's also just a nice way to, like, take a break. Especially if we're in a three-hour class, we just go outside and chill for a bit. I don't have to think about my projects at that moment.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Oh, so do you think you stop thinking when you smoke? Because I feel like some people use it as a break to actually think more. Like, they step away from their work, and while they're not physically in front of it, they're thinking about it more clearly.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I mean, for me, I get to take a step back as if I'm not the one designing the things I'm designing. It helps me look at things from an outside perspective instead of being glued to my screen 24/7. I just get to, like, think plainly about it, if that makes sense.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So I guess we gotta have no stress for us to quit.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Oh my God. Don't say that shit, man. That's awful.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">(laughs) Never mind. Alright, I'm cutting it here—we're done.</span>

            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">So my name is Diego Bonilla Gross and I think I smoke around three cigarettes a day.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Three? That's average. Um… did you know that actually one cigarette equals 20 minutes of your life, like in a lifespan wise?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I actually did know that, I saw that recently.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">You did?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">But actually for us because we're men it's 17 minutes, for women it's 22 minutes, so the average is 20 minutes but the reality is 17 for us.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Mmm… that sucks.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So you know, you know that it shortens your lifespan so why do you still do it?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Damn… I enjoy it, it keeps me calm. I feel like it levels me out when I'm stressed. Also, as a student, I feel like it's a little break from my work. Like I come back to my work with a fresher mind.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">But don't think that applies after student life too, though, like you going into a corporation is gonna be like, lowkey in a similar environment where hella people still smoke in your job and then you're gonna be like, oh, I'll take a break with you.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">(laughs) Imma hope not. Imma hope not. I hope that after college I quit. That's the plot I have behind it.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">You think being in like, specifically our school, matters a lot? like, defines that we smoke a lot in our school. Especially outside of the school, you know. I don't feel like it's really normal, like, I would go to Rutgers University or some other school to see nobody smoking.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I would definitely say there's a school influence behind it because like all Parsons students will smoke one I say. I feel like if you don't smoke a cigarette, then it's kind of like you're left out in a weird way. Also everyone wants that, like the New York aesthetic, yeah (laughs).</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So, you think being in our school affects it; does it mean that you just want to socialize mostly while, or the other way?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah, I would smoke to socialize, but it's also just like a break, I don't know. I smoke for a break.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So you would only smoke when you're doing work, or like, would you also smoke to just, like, break from anything?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">No, I only smoke when I'm doing work, honestly. Okay, doing work and possibly when you're drunk? Oh, when I'm drunk, too. But it's also a break, you're taking a break from drinking. It's a break from drinking.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So when you take a break from work and smoke, do you think a lot when you smoke, or do you just be like, oh, like damn near mindless?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I'm pretty mindless when I'm smoking, cause I don't really wanna think about my work. I kind of just want to step back from it. And I feel like if I'm thinking about my work, I'm still in the mind of being in the studio instead of being out of it.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So it's like you feel like you're still working if you think about it?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">If I think about it, it's not really a break if I'm thinking about it… you know what I'm saying?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah. But like, if you're not socializing like doing it with multiple people in a group or whatever, do you like listening to music while you do it or anything? Or do you just like white noise?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I would definitely say music. I definitely like to listen to music while I smoke outside. I'd rather smoke alone actually. It just feels better that way and plus it's kind of weird to listen to music while you're smoking and talking to others.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Makes sense. Is there a typical genre or a song that you like listening to?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Nah, my music tastes really bipolar. It's gonna be like Clairo once a second, then like Glokk40Spaz the next second. All smoking one.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">But if you need to pick one song what is it. that you can listen to anytime. Like mid class, mid… i don't know… anything, mid fucking, mid after fucking, mid working, mid sleeping.</span>

            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yes, definitely. Back home, I'd say 70% of the population smokes, so it's really normal there. And in the city, when I'm outside school, I see so many people smoking, so I'm like, "Why should I quit? Everyone is smoking."</span>

                <span class="answer">Definitely, definitely. I've made so many friends just sitting in front of the school smoking, sparing cigarettes for people, and just starting conversations. It's a good way to meet people.</span>

                <span class="answer">Probably like five to six times, I smoke alone. The rest, I smoke with my roommate or friends at school.</span>

                <span class="question">So did you start with vaping first or cigarettes?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I've been smoking since middle school. Like, seventh grade. I smoked cigarettes because in Korea it wasn't normal to vape at the time. I was basically smoking for two years and then everyone found out. They all called me a bitch. So I quit for a year, but I ended up relapsing (laughs).</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">When you were in eighth grade?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So why do you still smoke? It's been like six years, right?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah. Um… I think I formed an addiction, and it makes me feel good. Like, for me, from a young age, I learned to release my stress through cigarettes. I was really fucking stressed about multiple things… and me being so young, I thought smoking would be a great solution. And honestly, it did make me feel better.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So do you smoke to take breaks in school? I feel like a lot of people at work and school take breaks by smoking.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Well, now that I have a vape, I don't have to, but I just end up smoking a lot of cigarettes too because most people at our school do. So in school… I end up taking breaks with like a group of eight people, and we all smoke together.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah, I get that. Do you think a lot when you smoke, or do you just zone out?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I mean, yeah. I'm very aware that I'm smoking because the nicotine is hitting my lungs, right? So I'm aware of that, but I don't think, like, "I should quit" while I'm smoking. But after? A few minutes later, when I start feeling that strong nausea, I think to myself, "Maybe I should quit. Or at least smoke less."</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So let's say you take a break in school and smoke. Are you thinking about school, or are you trying not to think at all?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I think I do think about school.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Some people say smoking helps them organize their thoughts. Like, when you're not in front of your computer, you're still mentally working through stuff. Obviously, for people in Communication Design, they're always on their laptop. But since you're in Fine Arts, I guess you're always in front of a canvas or something. Do you feel like smoking lets you step back and see things differently?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah. I mean, for example, painting—the more you stare at your own painting, the worse it starts to look. That's usually when I know it's time for a break.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So smoking kind of helps you reset?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah, but I also feel like that can just be an excuse to smoke. Like, instead of saying "I need a break" I'll just say "I need a cigarette." But when I do take that break, I try not to think about work. I kind of force myself to put my mind somewhere else. Just focus on the cigarette.</span>

            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Do you smoke alone a lot, or only with people? Some people only smoke when they drink, or just to socialize.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I mean, that's part of it, but I do smoke alone a lot. I'll go outside of my room two or three times a day just to smoke by myself. And at school, I obviously smoke with people—that's how I socialize.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Do you listen to music when you smoke? I know it's more common when you're alone, since you can't just share earbuds with someone at school.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Oh yeah, I love smoking while listening to music. It makes it taste better. And honestly, it makes me more vulnerable to myself. Like, when I'm alone, listening to music and smoking, I start talking to myself. I think about what's wrong, what's stressing me out… and I just smoke it away with music. It's really healing for me, which is weird because these are killing me.</span>

            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Not really. It depends on my mood, but I definitely don't listen to loud party music. I like chill, ambient stuff (laughs).</span>

            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Probably "Princeton Review" by Team Sleep. I think it's one of those songs that makes a cigarette taste the best ever. Oh, and I love the lyrics.</span>

            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Sure, I care about it. I care about a lot of things. But I think the pros outweigh the cons.</span>

            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah, there's nobody who smokes who doesn't already know it's unhealthy.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">

            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So what do you think is your biggest reason—or like, your greatest pro behind smoking?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I don't carry a watch, so sometimes I don't check the time very often. I think as I've gotten older, cigarettes have become like a ritual—they keep my mind on a different kind of clock. One about pleasure and breaks. So in that way, it's like a reward system. And it's also just that I like having something to do with my hands. I like to… I like to be waiting for something. Always. I like knowing that whenever I'm done doing what I'm doing—whether I like it or not—there's a cigarette to be smoked in my future. I enjoy that feeling.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">It's almost like a built-in break in class.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah, yeah. I just pull it out whenever I need it, and it takes me away from whatever moment I'm in. Sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad way. But I think, in general, it's just a break in my life.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Okay, so since our school is in the city and most of the students here either smoke or have been smoking for a while, do you think that encourages you to smoke even more?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Just being around people that are already smoking?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah, and also as a way to socialize. Like, in every class, there's always a group of people taking smoke breaks together.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah, totally. I think that's another pro I didn't even mention, one that I don't think about enough. The social aspect of it. It's like drinking. It's like anything else you do socially—it's a common goal between people, and it just feels natural. And I think people want things like that.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah, definitely. So you said you smoke ten to sixteen times a day.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Somewhere around there, yeah.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So how many times do you smoke alone?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">See, that's the thing. That's why my number varies so much. If I'm not really doing much all day, I'll smoke like eight cigarettes alone. Which is… I prefer to smoke by myself for sure. But when I'm around other people? Man, if there's beer involved, you bet I'll smoke a whole damn pack. I'll smoke the whole damn thing, and it won't mean shit to me (laughs). Because of that, I prefer smoking alone—it feels more like a conscious decision.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah, I get that (laughs).</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">And I just enjoy it more by myself. But other people definitely bring it out in me. That's when I really need something to do with my hands. You know what I'm saying? That's when I really feel the need to fidget, the need to whip something out, put something in my mouth. It's just a fixation. And I'm totally fine with that.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So when you smoke alone, do you usually think a lot, or do you try to clear your mind?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Life's been good recently, so every time I smoke, it feels like a celebration. You know when you pull a cold glass of water? That's how smoking feels to me. I always drink something cold when I smoke—I always have some kind of liquid with me. But to answer your question, smoking doesn't really provoke me to get deep in thought. I just think about whatever I was already thinking about. It doesn't bring anything out of me that wasn't already there. It's more like… it gives me a reason to go outside, sit down, and just do what I gotta do.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah, do you usually listen to music when you smoke alone?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I don't like to. I will if I'm at school or if I was already listening to music, but in general, I prefer not to. That's one thing that actually does make me think a little more. When I'm smoking alone, I tend to think about all the other potential distractions I could have. One of those is music. So I usually don't listen to anything—it's just a natural moment.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">Yeah, I totally get that.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">But I do have one song I end up listening to a lot when I smoke—"Moscow Old School" by Bad Balance. It's this early 90s Russian hip-hop track. It's talking about Moscow, about Russia, about partying and living in a big city like that. I just love that song. It's really melodic and kind of puts me in a certain headspace.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">So you feel like that's a song that sits in the background without disrupting the process?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">Yeah, yeah. It kind of changes my vibe a little. It's pretty spunky, like a pretty happy song, so it gets me into this on-edge feeling, in a good way. I just feel good when I listen to that song. And if that's paired with a cigarette? That's a beautiful thing.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="question">(laughs) Yeah, do you have anything more to say about smoking?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <span class="answer">I think the biggest thing that allows me to keep smoking is my fitness. I'm equally as concerned with smoking, drinking, and all that shit as I am with keeping my body healthy. And I think people shouldn't overlook that. Like, as much as I act like I don't care about the statistics, I know this shit will probably make me sick later in life. But if I'm gonna have a bad habit, I might as well feel good and be healthy while I'm doing it. I encourage everybody else to do the same.</span>
